## 📖 Overview
Most option calculators are "Black Boxes"—they take inputs and spit out a price with no explanation. This project is a **"Glass Box"**. It uses the **Black-Scholes Model** but focuses on **interpretability** and **trust**.

It features:
1.  **Plain English Risk:** Explains Greeks in simple sentences (e.g., *"For every $1 the stock goes up, you make $0.50"*).
2.  **Real vs. Hope Value:** Visually separates Intrinsic Value (Real) from Time Value (Hope).
3.  **The Time Machine:** A backtesting engine that proves the strategy's effectiveness using historical data from Yahoo Finance.
