Comprehensive Derivatives & Option Pricing Toolkit
Introduction
Welcome to my project on financial derivatives and option pricing. This toolkit is designed to provide both a learning platform and practical analytics for key instruments in quantitative finance. The project is built to help visualize, price, and simulate a variety of contracts, focusing on both core concepts and advanced techniques relevant for finance professionals and learners.

Features & Modules
1. Fundamentals: Forwards, Futures, Vanilla Options
Pricing Algorithms: Compute fair value for forward and futures contracts using standard formulas.

Payoff Plots: Visualize profit/loss scenarios for vanilla options (call and put).

Trading Simulator: Analyze real-world position outcomes (long/short).

2. Vanilla Option Payoffs & Black-Scholes Pricing
Flexible Payoff Visualizer: Plot payoffs for any vanilla option structure.

Black-Scholes Pricer: Accurately compute European option prices; compare outputs with graphical payoff profiles.

3. Greeks & Hedging Strategies (Advanced module, unlock after learning core concepts)
Option Greeks Calculator: Calculate sensitivity measures (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho).

Hedge Simulator: Model hedging strategies and monitor risk changes.

Interactive Examples: Implement classic hedges such as delta-neutral trading.

4. Exotic Options & Monte Carlo Simulation (Advanced module, unlock after learning prerequisites)
Exotic Option Pricing: Develop Monte Carlo models for Asian and barrier options.

Simulation Benchmarks: Compare simulation results to Black-Scholes outputs for complex contracts.

Getting Started
Clone the repository.

Set up the Python environment with recommended packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.

Start with the Jupyter notebooks provided for each module.

Progress through each section as concepts are mastered in class or self-study.

For dashboard or advanced interactivity, refer to the Streamlit or Dash example scripts.

Learning Outcomes
Develop modular code for derivative pricing and scenario analysis.

Gain hands-on experience with core and advanced risk management tools.

Visualize, compare, and interpret financial models used in real trading and portfolio management.

Understand practical challenges and insights in quantitative finance through simulation and analytics.
